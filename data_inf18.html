			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>
				This article focuses on the use of data gloves for human-computer
				interaction concepts, where external sensors cannot always fully observe
				the userâ€™s hand. A good concept hereby allows to intuitively switch the
				interaction context on demand by using different hand gestures. The
				recognition of various, possibly complex hand gestures, however,
				introduces unintentional overhead to the system. Consequently, we
				present a data glove prototype comprising a glove-embedded gesture
				classifier utilizing data from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in the
				fingertips. In an extensive set of experiments with 57 participants, our
				system was tested with 22 hand gestures, all taken from the French Sign
				Language (LSF) alphabet. Results show that our system is capable of
				detecting the LSF alphabet with a mean accuracy score of 92% and an F1
				score of 91%, using complementary filter with a
				gyroscope-to-accelerometer ratio of 93%. Our approach has also been
				compared to the local fusion algorithm on an IMU motion sensor, showing
				faster settling times and less delays after gesture changes. Real-time
				performance of the recognition is shown to occur within 63 milliseconds,
				allowing fluent use of the gestures via Bluetooth-connected systems.
