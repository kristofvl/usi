				This data set contains a selection of raw acceleration data from a
				wrist-worn sensor being worn by six participants. The sensor is worn
				24/7, thus recording all human motion and activities throughout the day,
				including a specifically chosen and annotated leisure activity which
				spans 30-90 minutes per day depending on the participant. Further data
				set properties: The data is recorded with the
				<a href="http://kristofvl.github.io/HedgeHog/">HedgeHog sensor</a>,
				logging acceleration in 3 dimensions, sampled at 100 Hertz. The
				acceleration samples are time-stamped, and are accompanied with ambient
				light sensor data. The sensor was worn at the dominant wrist of the test
				subjects. The activities of interest are the participants' leisure
				activities: badminton, cycling, flamenco dancing, playing guitar, gym
				workout, zumba aerobics. The plot below shows the acceleration data (raw
				per axis of the 3D accelerometer), over one of the days in the dataset.
				The X axis displays the time during the day (from 9am till 8am) and the
				Y axis the acceleration values. The black markers in the main plot
				represent the motif occurrences for the activity "cycling". The density
				of those occurrences (lower plot) can then be used for classification.
