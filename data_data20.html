			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>
				We have presented an analytical tool for the quality review of 10
				publicly available photoplethysmography (PPG) datasets, based on 7
				multi-varied decision metrics. Although all datasets were advertised to
				contain raw signals, the characteristics of the PPG data look quite
				diverse. Our developed tool enables to automatically analyze the
				suitability and applicability of datasets and helps to identify
				preprocessed and filtered signals with a limited evidence. The raw
				reference data, recorded with the MAX86140EVSYS# evaluation system, as
				well as the implemented Python tool, based on the presented 7 decision
				metrics, are available for download below, to support the
				reproducibility and the review of new datasets.

				signals can be downloaded via the following links: <br />
