				With IBSync we have presented a novel method for the intentional or
				incidental synchronization as well as the implicit contextualization of
				wearable devices by touching, approaching, or passing certain areas,
				surfaces, or objects. Those are equipped with an embedded transmitter
				beacon that capacitively induces artificial landmark signals into the
				user’s body. Because no off-the-shelf intra-body communication
				transceivers are available, the analog ECG front-ends of commercial
				wearable devices have been repurposed. Those are carefully designed
				regarding their energy efficiency and the sensitive detection of tiny
				signals on the human skin. With a synchronization error of 0.80±1.79
				samples, or 6.25±14.00 ms at a sampling rate of 128 Hz, we outperformed
				motion-based offline synchronization methods with a typical error in the
				order of 250 down to 46 ms. The provided data, which our evaluation is
				based on, contains measurements from three experiments: 1) ambient noise
				captured by the ECG AFEs; 2) measurements from a controlled setting to
				evaluate the optimal parameters and the system’s performance a) directly
				touching the electrode, b) touching the desktop, and c) leaning back in
				the office chair; 3) measurements from an everyday life setting,
				demonstrating the feasibility and applicability in-the-wild.
