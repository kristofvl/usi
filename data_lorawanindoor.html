				A comprehensive dataset of LoRaWAN path loss measurements collected over
				a six-month period in a multi-room indoor office environment (~240m²,
				290m above sea level) at the University of Siegen. Six strategically
				placed end devices and a single gateway systematically captured signal
				quality indicators -- including RSSI, SNR, and spreading factor --
				alongside environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity,
				CO<sub>2</sub>
				concentration, barometric pressure, and PM2.5 levels) at 1-minute
				intervals, and stored in a time-stamped InfluxDB database. This dataset
				enables in-depth analysis of how environmental dynamics and physical
				obstructions (e.g., walls and partitions) impact LoRaWAN signal
				propagation indoors. Measurements reveal that transient phenomena such
				as reflections, human activity, and furniture rearrangements can alter
				signal attenuation by over 10 dB. In addition to device and
				environmental parameters, each record includes derived metrics:
				effective signal power (ESP) and noise power (NP), enabling robust
				modeling. Example analyses -- including environment-aware path loss and
				shadowing models -- demonstrate that integrating structural and
				environmental features significantly improves prediction accuracy. The
				dataset supports research on indoor wireless propagation, distance
				estimation, energy optimization, and adaptive IoT deployment for
				next-generation (6G) systems.
