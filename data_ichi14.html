				The monitoring of sleep by quantifying sleeping time and quality is
				pivotal in many preventive health care scenarios. A substantial amount
				of wearable sensing products have been introduced to the market for just
				this reason, detecting whether the user is either sleeping or awake.
				Assessing these devices for their accuracy in estimating sleep is a
				daunting task, as their hardware design tends to be different and many
				are closed-source systems that have not been clinically tested. In this
				paper, we present a challenging benchmark dataset from an open source
				wrist-worn data logger that contains relatively high-frequent (100Hz) 3D
				inertial data from 42 sleep lab patients, along with their data from
				clinical polysomnography. We analyse this dataset with two traditional
				approaches for detecting sleep and wake states and propose a new
				algorithm specifically for 3D acceleration data, Estimation of
				Stationary Sleep-segments (ESS). Results show that all three methods
				generally over-estimate for sleep, with our method performing slightly
				better (74% overall mean accuracy) than the traditional activity
				count-based methods. The figure shows a sample from the sleeping lab
				data set that can be obtained for further studies. The data set consists
				of timestamped raw acceleration data, light intensity readings and the
				sleep stages (awake, NoREM1-3, REM).
