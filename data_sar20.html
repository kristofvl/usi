				Depth imaging has, through recent technological advances, become
				ubiquitous as products become smaller, more affordable, and more
				precise. Depth cameras have also emerged as a promising modality for
				activity recognition as they allow detection of users’ body joints and
				postures. Increased resolutions have now enabled a novel use of depth
				cameras that facilitate more fine-grained activity descriptors: The
				remote detection of a person’s breathing by picking up the small
				distance changes from the user’s chest over time. We propose in this
				work a novel method to model chest elevation to robustly monitor a
				user’s respiration, whenever users are sitting or standing, and facing
				the camera. The method is robust to users occasionally blocking their
				torso region and is able to provide meaningful breathing features to
				allow classification in activity recognition tasks. We illustrate that
				with this method, with specific activities such as paced-breathing
				meditating, performing breathing exercises, or post-exercise recovery,
				our model delivers a breathing accuracy that matches that of a
				commercial respiration chest monitor belt. Results show that the
				breathing rate can be detected with our method at an accuracy of 92 to
				97% from a distance of two metres, outperforming state-of-the-art depth
				imagining methods especially for non-sedentary persons, and allowing
				separation of activities in respiration-derived features space.
