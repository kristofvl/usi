   abstract = {Background: Assistive Robotic Arms are designed to assist physically disabled people with daily activities. Existing joysticks and head controls are not applicable for severely disabled people such as people with Locked-in Syndrome. Therefore, eye tracking control is part of ongoing research. The related literature spans many disciplines, creating a heterogeneous field that makes it difficult to gain an overview.

Objectives: This work focuses on ARAs that are controlled by gaze and eye movements. By answering the research questions, this paper provides details on the design of the systems, a comparison of input modalities, methods for measuring the performance of these controls, and an outlook on research areas that gained interest in recent years.

Methods: This review was conducted as outlined in the PRISMA 2020 Statement. After identifying a wide range of approaches in use the authors decided to use the PRISMA-ScR extension for a scoping review to present the results. The identification process was carried out by screening three databases. After the screening process, a snowball search was conducted.

Results: 39 articles and 6 reviews were included in this article. Characteristics related to the system and study design were extracted and presented divided into three groups based on the use of eye tracking.

Conclusion: This paper aims to provide an overview for researchers new to the field by offering insight into eye tracking based robot controllers. We have identified open questions that need to be answered in order to provide people with severe motor function loss with systems that are highly useable and accessible.}

  abstract = {Wearable sensors hold multiple advantages: Having sensors that are closer, on the skin, to the human user allows for more information and, when those sensors are worn throughout the day (and, in many cases, even night and day), the data these sensors produce tend to cover many aspects of the user’s life. This chapter attempts to predict what type of wearable sensors—for there are many—and to what extent wearables will be particularly attractive as mobile sensors in psychology. As is the case with predictions, this only makes sense when looking at the prevailing and current trends in research in the area of wearable sensing, in order to be able to extrapolate what might become feasible in the coming years and decades. Technology-wise, this does not only depend on the sensors themselves: Other key components that have become common in wearables, such as wireless communication and energy demands, are equally important in this picture. Furthermore, the concept of wearable sensing does not depend only on the used hardware components: The information that is generated from the sensor signals, and where and how this information is analyzed, abstracted, and interpreted, are equally important. From these analyses of what will become technically possible in wearable sensing, a set of promising applications is extracted and presented in the final section of this chapter.},

  abstract={Despite the simplicity of labels and extensive study protocols provided during data collection, the majority of researchers in sensor-based technologies tend to rely on annotations provided by a combination of field experts and researchers themselves. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the quality of annotations provided by expert versus novice annotators for inertial-based activity benchmark datasets. We consider multiple parameters such as the nature of the activities to be labeled, and the annotation tool, to quantify the annotation quality and time needed. 15 participants were tasked to annotate a total of 40 minutes of data from two publicly available benchmark datasets for inertial activity recognition, being simultaneously displayed both video and accelerometer data during annotation. We compare the resulting labels with the ground truth provided by the original dataset authors. Our participants annotated the data using two representative tools. Metrics like F1-Score and Cohen’s Kappa showed experience did not ensure better labels. While experts were more accurate on the complex Wetlab dataset (51% vs 46%), Novices had 96% F1 on the simple WEAR dataset versus 92% for experts. Comparable Kappa scores (0.96 and 0.94 for WEAR, 0.53 and 0.59 for Wetlab) indicated similar quality for both groups, revealing differences in dataset complexity. Furthermore, experts annotated faster regardless of the tool. Given proven success across research, our findings suggest crowdsourcing wearable dataset annotation to non-experts warrants exploration as a valuable yet underinvestigated approach, up to a complexity level beyond which quality may suffer.},

In this work, the application of social and collaborative robots in care facilities and workshops for the disabled is presented by providing a requirements analysis. The use of the humanoid robot Pepper in assisted living was tested and subsequently evaluated in interviews with caregivers who initiated and observed the interaction between the group and the robot. Additionally, robotic applications in assisted work were assessed, resulting in a divergence from the industrial use of robots. A comparative overview with recent literature is presented. The connection between the community home and the workshop raised the question of whether the use of different robots in both places could lead to conflicts.",

By using a strategy based on prompt composition and dynamic retrieval of fuzzy matches, we achieved improvements in the translation quality compared to previous work. Unlike static selection, which may not adequately meet all request sentences, our enhanced methodology allows for dynamic adaptation based on user input. It was also shown that LLMs and Encoder-Decoder models achieve better results with generic texts than with subtitles for the language pairs English-to-Arabic (En→Ar) and English-to-French (En→Fr). Experiments on datasets with different sizes for En→Ar subtitles indicate that the bigger is not really the better. Our experiments on subtitles support results from previous work on generic text that LLMs are capable of adapting to In-Context learning with few-shot, outperforming Encoder-Decoder MT models and that the combination of LLMs and Encoder-Decoder models improves the quality of the translation.}

In reality, however, such visions have not galvanized: What happened? And could operators’ attitudes and misgivings toward wearables be responsible?

ABSTRACT = {We present a benchmark dataset for evaluating physical human activity recognition methods from wrist-worn sensors, for the specific setting of basketball training, drills, and games. Basketball activities lend themselves well for measurement by wrist-worn inertial sensors, and systems that are able to detect such sport-relevant activities could be used in applications of game analysis, guided training, and personal physical activity tracking. The dataset was recorded from two teams in separate countries (USA and Germany) with a total of 24 players who wore an inertial sensor on their wrist, during both a repetitive basketball training session and a game. Particular features of this dataset include an inherent variance through cultural differences in game rules and styles as the data was recorded in two countries, as well as different sport skill levels since the participants were heterogeneous in terms of prior basketball experience. We illustrate the dataset's features in several time-series analyses and report on a baseline classification performance study with two state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.},

With researchers from a multitude of human- centered studies knowing of the existence of the said effect, quantita- tive studies investigating the neutrality and quality of data gathered in monitored versus unmonitored setups, particularly in the con- text of Human Activity Recognition (HAR), remain largely under- explored. With the development of tracking devices providing the possibility of carrying out less invasive observation of participants’ conduct, this study provides a data-driven approach to measure the effects of observation on participants’ execution of five workout- based activities. Using both classical feature analysis and deep learning-based methods we analyze the accelerometer data of 10 participants, showing that a different degree of observation only marginally influences captured patterns and predictive performance of classification algorithms. Although our findings do not dismiss the existence of the Hawthorne Effect, it does challenge the prevail- ing notion of the applicability of laboratory compared to in-the-wild recorded data.

      abstract={Avatar technology can offer accessibility possibilities and improve the Deaf-and-Hard of Hearing sign language users access to communication, education and services, such as the healthcare system. However, sign language users acceptance of signing avatars as well as their attitudes towards them vary and depend on many factors. Furthermore, research on avatar technology is mostly done by researchers who are not Deaf. The study examines the extent to which intrinsic or extrinsic factors contribute to predict the attitude towards avatars across cultures. Intrinsic factors include the characteristics of the avatar, such as appearance, movements and facial expressions. Extrinsic factors include users technology experience, their hearing status, age and their sign language fluency. This work attempts to answer questions such as, if lower attitude ratings are related to poor technology experience with ASL users, for example, is that also true for Moroccan Sign Language (MSL) users? For the purposes of the study, we designed a questionnaire to understand MSL users attitude towards avatars. Three groups of participants were surveyed: Deaf (57), Hearing (20) and Hard-of-Hearing (3). The results of our study were then compared with those reported in other relevant studies.}

  abstract = {Though research has shown the complementarity of camera- and inertial-based data, datasets which offer both egocentric video and inertial-based sensor data remain scarce. In this paper, we introduce WEAR, an outdoor sports dataset for both vision- and inertial-based human activity recognition (HAR). The dataset comprises data from 18 participants performing a total of 18 different workout activities with untrimmed inertial (acceleration) and camera (egocentric video) data recorded at 10 different outside locations. Unlike previous egocentric datasets, WEAR provides a challenging prediction scenario marked by purposely introduced activity variations as well as an overall small information overlap across modalities. Benchmark results obtained using each modality separately show that each modality interestingly offers complementary strengths and weaknesses in their prediction performance. Further, in light of the recent success of temporal action localization models following the architecture design of the ActionFormer, we demonstrate their versatility by applying them in a plain fashion using vision, inertial and combined (vision + inertial) features as input. Results demonstrate both the applicability of vision-based temporal action localization models for inertial data and fusing both modalities by means of simple concatenation, with the combined approach (vision + inertial features) being able to produce the highest mean average precision and close-to-best F1-score.

  abstract = {Research into the detection of human activities from wearable sensors is a highly active field, benefiting numerous applications, from ambulatory monitoring of healthcare patients via fitness coaching to streamlining manual work processes. We present an empirical study that compares 4 different commonly used annotation methods utilized in user studies that focus on in-the-wild data. These methods can be grouped in user-driven, in situ annotations - which are performed before or during the activity is recorded - and recall methods - where participants annotate their data in hindsight at the end of the day. Our study illustrates that different labeling methodologies directly impact the annotations' quality, as well as the capabilities of a deep learning classifier trained with the data respectively. We noticed that in situ methods produce less but more precise labels than recall methods. Furthermore, we combined an activity diary with a visualization tool that enables the participant to inspect and label their activity data. Due to the introduction of such a tool were able to decrease missing annotations and increase the annotation consistency, and therefore the F1-score of the deep learning model by up to 8% (ranging between 82.1 and 90.4% F1-score). Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the methods compared in our study, the biases they may could introduce and the consequences of their usage on human activity recognition studies and as well as possible solutions.}

In terms of human computer interaction (HCI), they are characterized by complex IT infrastructures providing numerous graphical user interfaces. More modern approaches have been researched for decades. However, they are rarely used. What role does the attitude of operators towards novel solutions play? In one of the first quantitative cross-domain studies in safety-related HCI research (N = 155), we gained insight into affinity for technology interaction (ATI) and wish for pervasive computing solutions of operators in three domains (emergency response, public utilities, maritime traffic). Results show that ATI values were rather high, with broader range only in maritime traffic operators. Furthermore, the assessment of autonomy is more strongly related to the desire for novel solutions than perceived added safety value. These findings can provide guidance for the design of pervasive computing solutions, not only but especially for users in safety-critical contexts.},

By using LstSim, a community-driven emergency control room simulator, we aim to recreate the work environment of a dispatcher, induce a cognitive load, and measure the response in the user’s breathing. Participants were monitored and recorded through wearable sensors, depth cameras below the screens, and simulation-internal parameters and interactions. The participants’ breathing patterns were analyzed to identify changes in breathing amplitude in response to varying levels of cognitive load. The results of our study provide compelling evidence that a simulated control room environment is successful in inducing cognitive load on participants shown in a significant increase in NASA TLX scores as well as a 13% increase in breathing amplitude. Despite the challenges posed by this individual variability, our findings also highlight the potential of using breathing as a real-time, noninvasive measure of cognition in control rooms. This has significant implications for the design and operation of emergency control rooms, potentially leading to the development of more responsive systems that adapt to the operator’s cognition load, thereby enhancing performance and effectiveness.}

However, scalability relates not only to user interface and interaction design but to automation. Whether and how automation scales or can be scaled regarding HCI has hardly been addressed by previous research. By introducing a one-day user journey focusing on automation experience, we discuss characteristics and research directions for safe and satisfying scaled automation experiences.},

  abstract = {Wearable pupil detection systems often separate the analysis of the captured wearer's eye images for wirelessly-tethered back-end systems. We argue in this paper that investigating hardware-software co-designs would bring along opportunities to make such systems smaller and more efficient. We introduce an open-source embedded system for wearable, non-invasive pupil detection in real-time, on the wearable, embedded platform itself. Our system consists of a head-mounted eye tracker prototype, which combines two miniature camera systems with Raspberry Pi-based embedded system. Apart from the hardware design, we also contribute a pupil detection pipeline that operates using edge analysis, natively on the embedded system at 30fps and run-time of 54ms at 480x640 and 23ms at 240x320. Average cumulative error of 5.3368px is found on the LPW dataset for a detection rate of 51.9% with our detection pipeline. For evaluation on our hardware-specific camera frames, we also contribute a dataset of 35000 images, from 20 participants.}

Our system monitors the breathing-induced movement of the user's chest, delivering a respiration curve from the camera depth stream by mean- or median-based averaging of single-distances to pixels in the target body region over time. The system was evaluated in an experiment on 8 study participants. The mean-based respiratory rate estimation presented fewer errors and the system works best at close proximity. At 1m distance, it presents a correlation to a respiration belt as ground truth of 0.94 and an absolute error of 0.04bpm. From our data, no influence on the performance of the system was found by gender or different respiration rate. The final system does not require extensive knowledge to set up and operate. The approach allows users to monitor their breathing rate while working, opening up new e-health application areas. They range from self-care and healthcare to managing operators in safety-critical systems such as control rooms, since the respiratory rate is closely linked to a person's state of attention.}

Wearable inertial sensor data have as a consequence been employed to automatically detect human activities, lately predominantly with deep learning methods. This article focuses on the necessity of recurrent layers—more specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers—in common Deep Learning architectures for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Our experimental pipeline investigates the effects of employing none, one, or two LSTM layers, as well as different layers' sizes, within the popular DeepConvLSTM architecture. We evaluate the architecture's performance on five well-known activity recognition datasets and provide an in-depth analysis of the per-class results, showing trends which type of activities or datasets profit the most from the removal of LSTM layers. For 4 out of 5 datasets, an altered architecture with one LSTM layer produces the best prediction results. In our previous work we already investigated the impact of a 2-layered LSTM when dealing with sequential activity data. Extending upon this, we now propose a metric, rGP, which aims to measure the effectiveness of learned temporal patterns for a dataset and can be used as a decision metric whether to include recurrent layers into a network at all. Even for datasets including activities without explicit temporal processes, the rGP can be high, suggesting that temporal patterns were learned, and consequently convolutional networks are being outperformed by networks including recurrent layers. We conclude this article by putting forward the question to what degree popular HAR datasets contain unwanted temporal dependencies, which if not taken care of, can benefit networks in achieving high benchmark scores and give a false sense of overall generability to a real-world setting.}

This paper examines the extent to which sheep herding and the relationships between humans, dogs, and sheep can be a suitable model for shaping human-computer cooperation in process control. Even though sheep herding has already been discussed in various relationships to HCI, a systematic discussion of the factors that underlie successful human-animal cooperation is lacking. This is introduced in this paper based on an expert interview and literature research. Based on this, it is discussed to what extent the success factors can be transferred to the design of technical systems and human-computer cooperation.},

We analyzed data from patients with epilepsy from four epilepsy centers. Patients wore wristbands recording accelerometry, electrodermal activity, blood volume pulse, and skin temperature. We calculated data completeness and assessed the time the device was worn (on-body), and modality-specific signal quality scores. We included 37,166 h from 632 patients in the inpatient and 90,776 h from 39 patients in the outpatient setting. All modalities were affected by artifacts. Data loss was higher when using data streaming (up to 49% among inpatient cohorts, averaged across respective recordings) as compared to onboard device recording and storage (up to 9%). On-body scores, estimating the percentage of time a device was worn on the body, were consistently high across cohorts (more than 80%). Signal quality of some modalities, based on established indices, was higher at night than during the day. A uniformly reported data quality and multimodal signal quality index is feasible, makes study results more comparable, and contributes to the development of devices and evaluation routines necessary for seizure monitoring.}

However, there is a risk, that this results in handling a growing number of devices and complex interactions. The question arises to what extent interaction concepts that were designed for single or a few devices can be transferred to such environments. This can be seen as a scaling problem in terms of cognitive ergonomics. This is also an important issue in safety-critical domains, where control rooms serve as central units, as the demands on operators are increasing. Support is needed in decision-making, communication and collaboration. This paper describes the research questions and methodology of the development of design principles for scalable interaction design in control rooms from a cognitive ergonomics perspective. The expected outcome is a set of concepts that are specifically suited for safety-critical pervasive computing environments.},

        abstract = { Background: One relevant strategy to prevent the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) focuses on increasing physical activity. The use of activity trackers by patients could enable objective measurement of their regular physical activity in daily life and promote physical activity through the use of a tracker-based intervention. This trial aims to answer three research questions: (1) Is the use of activity trackers suitable for longitudinal assessment of physical activity in everyday life? (2) Does the use of a tracker-based intervention lead to sustainable improvements in the physical activity of healthy individuals and in people with T2DM? (3) Does the accompanying digital motivational intervention lead to sustainable improvements in physical activity for participants using the tracker-based device?
Methods: The planned study is a randomized controlled trial focused on 1642 participants with and without T2DM for 9 months with regard to their physical activity behavior. Subjects allocated to an intervention group will wear an activity tracker. Half of the subjects in the intervention group will also receive an additional digital motivational intervention. Subjects allocated to the control group will not receive any intervention. The primary outcome is the amount of moderate and vigorous physical activity in minutes and the number of steps per week measured continuously with the activity tracker and assessed by questionnaires at four time points. Secondary endpoints are medical parameters measured at the same four time points. The collected data will be analyzed using inferential statistics and explorative data mining techniques.
Discussion: The trial uses an interdisciplinary approach with a team including sports psychologists, sports scientists, health scientists, health care professionals, physicians, and computer scientists. It also involves the processing and analysis of large amounts of data collected with activity trackers. These factors represent particular strengths as well as challenges in the study. Trial Registration: The trial is registered at the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform via the German Clinical Studies Trial Register (DRKS), DRKS00027064.

  abstract={Control rooms are safety-relevant working environments characterized by complex IT infrastructure. With regard to the interaction of operators with control room systems, usability has been the major criteria for decades. However, there is increasing discussion about the extent to which the concept of user experience (UX) also plays a role in such safety-critical contexts. What is still largely missing is the application of concrete UX-specific methods in the context of control rooms. This paper explains how and with what results 9 operators used an interaction vocabulary focusing on pragmatic and hedonic qualities to complete the sentence “I want my control room to be... ”. Results first suggest that pragmatic, i.e., usability-oriented, attributions are of greater importance to operators. However, especially the more UX-specific terms of the interaction vocabulary, which were initially not found to be so relevant, yielded many valuable hints and inspiration for the future design of control room workplaces. By reflecting on the process of discussing the aesthetics of interactions in such a safety-critical working environment, recommendations are provided for considering UX in safety.},

This, however, requires reliable and ambulatory detection of obsessive hand-washing. We present a novel technique which enables hand-washing detection by means of a wrist-worn, capacitive sensing device. It relies on the effect that touching running tap water yields a strong change in the capacitance between the wearer and the environment. The WetTouch system exploits this effect and we present first findings on the feasibility of such detection. For this, a set of seven pertinent activities with and without touching water was measured, and we found that hand-washing is clearly identifiable for two different subjects.

ABSTRACT = {Focal onset epileptic seizures are highly heterogeneous in their clinical manifestations, and a robust seizure detection across patient cohorts has to date not been achieved. Here, we assess and discuss the potential of supervised machine learning models for the detection of focal onset motor seizures by means of a wrist-worn wearable device, both in a personalized context as well as across patients. Wearable data were recorded in-hospital from patients with epilepsy at two epilepsy centers. Accelerometry, electrodermal activity, and blood volume pulse data were processed and features for each of the biosignal modalities were calculated. Following a leave-one-out approach, a gradient tree boosting machine learning model was optimized and tested in an intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation. In total, 20 seizures from 9 patients were included and we report sensitivities of 67% to 100% and false alarm rates of down to 0.85 per 24 h in the individualized assessment. Conversely, for an inter-subject seizure detection methodology tested on an out-of-sample data set, an optimized model could only achieve a sensitivity of 75% at a false alarm rate of 13.4 per 24 h. We demonstrate that robustly detecting focal onset motor seizures with tonic or clonic movements from wearable data may be possible for individuals, depending on specific seizure manifestations.},

        abstract = {State-of-the-art control rooms are equipped with a variety of input and output devices in terms of single-user workstations, shared public screens, and multimodal alarm systems. However, operators are bound to and sitting at their respective workstations for the most part of their shifts. Therefore, cooperation efforts are hampered, and physical activity is limited for several hours. Incorporating mobile devices, wearables and sensor technologies could improve on the current mode of operation but must be considered a paradigm shift from control rooms as a collection of technically networked but stationary workstations to control rooms as pervasive computing environments being aware of people and processes. However, based on the reviewed literature, systematic approaches to this paradigm shift taking usability and user experience into account are rare. In this work, we describe a root concept for control rooms as human-centered pervasive computing environments and introduce a framework for developing a wearable assistant as one of the central and novel components. Furthermore, we describe design challenges from a socio-technical perspective based on 9 expert interviews important for further research on pervasive computing environments in safety-critical domains.}

Methods: The primary purpose of this manuscript is to validate an open-source ambulatory assessment system that consists of hardware devices, algorithms, and software components of our approach. We report on two validation experiments, one lab-based treadmill study on a convenience sample of 16 volunteers and one ’in vivo’ study with
28 volunteers suffering from diabetes or cardiovascular disease.
Results: A comparison between data from ActiGraph GT9X trackers and our proposed system reveals that the original inertial sensor signals at the wrist strongly correlate (Pearson correlation coefficients for raw inertial sensor signals of 0.97 in the controlled treadmill-walking setting) and that estimated steps from an open-source wrist-based detection approach correlate with the hip- worn ActiGraph output (average Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.81 for minute- wise comparisons of detected steps) in day- long ambulatory data.
Conclusion: Recording inertial sensor data
in a standardized form and relying on open-source algorithms on these data form
a promising methodology that ensures
that datasets can be replicated or enriched long after the wearable trackers have been decommissioned.}

One popular Deep Learning architecture in HAR is the DeepConvLSTM. In this paper we propose to alter the DeepConvLSTM architecture to employ a 1-layered instead of a 2-layered LSTM. We validate our architecture change on 5 publicly available HAR datasets by comparing the predictive performance with and without the change employing varying hidden units within the LSTM layer(s). Results show that across all datasets, our architecture consistently improves on the original one: Recognition performance increases up to 11.7% for the F1-score, and our architecture significantly decreases the amount of learnable parameters. This improvement over DeepConvLSTM decreases training time by as much as 48%. Our results stand in contrast to the belief that one needs at least a 2-layered LSTM when dealing with sequential data. Based on our results we argue that said claim might not be applicable to sensor-based HAR.

ABSTRACT={As depth cameras have gotten smaller, more affordable, and more precise, they have also emerged as a promising sensor in ubiquitous systems, particularly for detecting objects, scenes, and persons. This article sets out to systematically evaluate how suitable depth data can be for picking up users’ respiration, from small distance changes across the torso over time. We contribute a large public dataset of depth data over time from 19 persons taken in a large variety of circumstances. On this data, we evaluate and compare different state-of-the-art methods and show that their individual performance significantly depends on a range of conditions and parameters. We investigate the influence of the observed torso region (e.g., the chest), the user posture and activity, the distance to the depth camera, the respiratory rate, the gender, and user specific peculiarities. Best results hereby are obtained from the chest whereas the abdomen is least suited for detecting the user’s breathing. In terms of accuracy and signal quality, the largest differences are observed on different user postures and activities. All methods can maintain a mean accuracy of above 92% when users are sitting, but half of the observed methods only achieve a mean accuracy of 51% while standing. When users are standing and additionally move their arms in front of their upper body, mean accuracy values between the worst and best performing methods range from 21 to 87%. Increasing the distance to the depth camera furthermore results in lower signal quality and decreased accuracy on all methods. Optimal results can be obtained at distances of 1–2 m. Different users have been found to deliver varying qualities of breathing signals. Causes range from clothing, over long hair, to movement. Other parameters have shown to play a minor role in the detection of users’ breathing.}

  abstract={The optical measurement principle photoplethysmography has emerged in today’s wearable devices as the standard to monitor the wearer’s heart rate in everyday life. This cost-effective and easy-to-integrate technique has transformed from the original transmission mode pulse oximetry for clinical settings to the reflective mode of modern ambulatory, wrist-worn devices. Numerous proposed algorithms aim at the efficient heart rate measurement and accurate detection of the consecutive pulses for the derivation of secondary features from the heart rate variability. Most, however, have been evaluated either on own, closed recordings or on public datasets that often stem from clinical pulse oximeters in transmission instead of wearables’ reflective mode. Signals tend furthermore to be preprocessed with filters, which are rarely documented and unintentionally fitted to the available and applied signals. We investigate the influence of preprocessing on the peak positions and present the benchmark of two cutting-edge pulse detection algorithms on actual raw measurements from reflective mode photoplethysmography. Based on 21806 pulse labels, our evaluation shows that the most suitable but still universal filter passband is located at 0.5 to 15.0Hz since it preserves the required harmonics to shape the peak positions.},

It is therefore not surprising that distributed monitoring of switchgear through local sensors, signal processing and analysis in real-time, has emerged as a promising research field. Of particular interest are the non-invasive detection of switching operations, their differentiation and ageing, which can be monitored by tracking acoustic emissions generated during a switching operation using small microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based sensors. This paper presents a novel and computationally efficient method that allows on-site feature selection and online classification of switchgear actions. Process-and design-specific features can be learned locally on the sensor system without the need of prior offline training. This avoids the high effort associated with adapting the model for other use cases offsite (e.g., analysis, feature selection, implementation). Besides, it offers the possibility to re-train the model, which may be required due to changes in the structure of the concerned application(e.g., replacement of components, ageing or changes in sensor position). Furthermore, the method is independent of the application, thus making it generic to other application areas. We evaluate our method as well as the MEMS sensors (acoustic and vibration) using datasets of switchgear measurements to differentiate between different switching operations. We furthermore show that the features selected by our method can be used to track changes in switching processes due to ageing effects.},

ABSTRACT="The electrical grid is highly dependent on switchgear to maintain a safe
and reliable power transmission. For this reason, the interest in on-site,
non-invasive monitoring solutions including the detection of switch
operations, their differentiation and ageing has significantly increased in
the last years. Thereby, the research field of tracking acoustic emissions
generated during the switching using low-cost micro-electro-mechanical
system (MEMS) based sensors is emerging. This paper presents a
computationally efficient method for selecting process- and design-specific
features on-site (on a sensor system or gateway) to eliminate the need of
prior offline training. This ensures generalized usability for different
switch types and sensor positions without high re-training effort. The
selected features are further used for online multi-class classification of
switching processes. The proposed self-learning method, as well as the use
of the MEMS sensors (acoustic and vibration), are both evaluated for
classification performance on switchgear measurements during twelve
different processes, leading to a robust classification with an accuracy of
over 95 \% in average."

  abstract = {The synchronization of wearable devices in distributed, multi-device systems is a persistent challenge. Particularly machine learning approaches suffer from the devices’ inaccurate clock sources and unmatched time. While the online synchronization based on radio transmission is energy-intensive, offline approaches originated in activity recognition suffer from inaccurate motion patterns. In recent years, intra-body communication emerged as a promising technique that uses the human body as a limited and hence more efficient medium. Due to the absence of commercial platforms, applications are rare and underinvestigated. To boost their development and to enable the precise synchronization, we introduce IBSync and propose to repurpose the ECG sensor in commercial wearable devices to detect artificial signals induced into the skin. The shorttime Fourier transform and Pearson’s normalized cross-correlation are used to detect, precisely locate, and assign synchronization landmarks within the measurements. Based on a total of 105 min of recordings, we evaluated the concept and demonstrate its general feasibility with a promising accuracy of 0.203 ± 1.633 samples (1.587 ± 12.755 ms) in typical proximity to the transmitter.

abstract="Background: Video electroencephalography recordings, routinely used in epilepsy monitoring units, are the gold standard for monitoring epileptic seizures. However, monitoring is also needed in the day-to-day lives of people with epilepsy, where video electroencephalography is not feasible. Wearables could fill this gap by providing patients with an accurate log of their seizures. Objective: Although there are already systems available that provide promising results for the detection of tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs), research in this area is often limited to detection from 1 biosignal modality or only during the night when the patient is in bed. The aim of this study is to provide evidence that supervised machine learning can detect TCSs from multimodal data in a new data set during daytime and nighttime. Methods: An extensive data set of biosignals from a multimodal watch worn by people with epilepsy was recorded during their stay in the epilepsy monitoring unit at 2 European clinical sites. From a larger data set of 243 enrolled participants, those who had data recorded during TCSs were selected, amounting to 10 participants with 21 TCSs. Accelerometry and electrodermal activity recorded by the wearable device were used for analysis, and seizure manifestation was annotated in detail by clinical experts. Ten accelerometry and 3 electrodermal activity features were calculated for sliding windows of variable size across the data. A gradient tree boosting algorithm was used for seizure detection, and the optimal parameter combination was determined in a leave-one-participant-out cross-validation on a training set of 10 seizures from 8 participants. The model was then evaluated on an out-of-sample test set of 11 seizures from the remaining 2 participants. To assess specificity, we additionally analyzed data from up to 29 participants without TCSs during the model evaluation. Results: In the leave-one-participant-out cross-validation, the model optimized for sensitivity could detect all 10 seizures with a false alarm rate of 0.46 per day in 17.3 days of data. In a test set of 11 out-of-sample TCSs, amounting to 8.3 days of data, the model could detect 10 seizures and produced no false positives. Increasing the test set to include data from 28 more participants without additional TCSs resulted in a false alarm rate of 0.19 per day in 78 days of wearable data. Conclusions: We show that a gradient tree boosting machine can robustly detect TCSs from multimodal wearable data in an original data set and that even with very limited training data, supervised machine learning can achieve a high sensitivity and low false-positive rate. This methodology may offer a promising way to approach wearable-based nonconvulsive seizure detection.",

  ABSTRACT = {In the past decade, inertial measurement sensors have found their way into many wearable devices where they are used in a broad range of applications, including fitness tracking, step counting, navigation, activity recognition, or motion capturing. One of their key features that is widely used in motion capturing applications is their capability of estimating the orientation of the device and, thus, the orientation of the limb it is attached to. However, tracking a human's motion at reasonable sampling rates comes with the drawback that a substantial amount of data needs to be transmitted between devices or to an end point where all device data is fused into the overall body pose. The communication typically happens wirelessly, which severely drains battery capacity and limits the use time. In this paper, we introduce fastSW, a novel piecewise linear approximation technique that efficiently reduces the amount of data required to be transmitted between devices. It takes advantage of the fact that, during motion, not all limbs are being moved at the same time or at the same speed, and only those devices need to transmit data that actually are being moved or that exceed a certain approximation error threshold. Our technique is efficient in computation time and memory utilization on embedded platforms, with a maximum of 210 instructions on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. Furthermore, in contrast to similar techniques, our algorithm does not affect the device orientation estimates to deviate from a unit quaternion. In our experiments on a publicly available dataset, our technique is able to compress the data to 10% of its original size, while achieving an average angular deviation of approximately 2° and a maximum angular deviation below 9°.},

Control rooms are crucial elements of safety-critical infrastructures (e.g., crisis management, emergency med-ical services, fire services, power supply, or traffic management). They have been studied in terms of Human-Computer Interaction with respect to routine and emergency operations, human-machine task allocation, interaction design and evaluation approaches for more than 30 years. However, they are dynamic and evolving environments with, for instance, the gradual introduction of higher lev-els of automation/autonomy. While state of the art control rooms are still characterized by stationary workstations with several smaller screens and large wall-mounted displays, introducing mobile and wearable devices as well as IoT solutions could enable more flexible and cooperative ways of working. The work-shop aims at understanding how recent technologies in HCI could change the way control rooms are designed, engineered and operated.

efforts are hampered, and physical activity is limited for several hours. Incorporating mobile devices, wearables and sensor technologies could improve on the current mode of operation but must be considered a paradigm shift from control rooms as a collection of technically networked but stationary workstations to control rooms as pervasive computing environments being aware of people and processes. However, based on the reviewed literature, systematic approaches to
this paradigm shift taking usability and user experience into account are rare. In this work, we describe a root concept for control rooms as human-centered pervasive computing environments and introduce a framework for developing a wearable assistant as one of the central and novel components.

        ABSTRACT={A long lasting challenge in wearable and ubiquitous computing has been to bridge the interaction gap between users and their computers. We can easily perceive and interpret contextual information, such as picking up whether someone is bored, stressed, busy, or fascinated in face-to-face interactions, which is still largely unsolved for computers in everyday life. The first message is that much of the research of the past decades aiming to alleviate this context gap between computers and their users, has clustered into three fields. They aim to model human users in different observable categories: Activity, Affect, and Attention. A second point is that the research fields aiming for machine recognition of these three A’s, thus far have had only a limited amount of overlap, but are bound to converge in terms of methodology and from a systems perspective. A final point then concludes with the following call to action: A consequence of such a possible merger between the three A’s is the need for a more consolidated way of performing solid, reproducible research studies. These fields can learn from each other’s best practices, their interaction can both lead to the creation of overarching benchmarks, as well as establish common data pipelines.}

This approach is already reaching its limits due to insufficient databases and almost no information about the stations’ condition being gathered between inspection intervals. A condition-based strategy that requires more maintenance for equipment with a high probability of failure is needed. Great potential is promised by intelligent sensor-based diagnostics, where objective comparability can be achieved by condition monitoring of the station fleet. Cost-effective micro-electromechanical (MEMS)-bases sensor systems promise to provide a suitable solution for network operators and enable a widespread use. In our paper, we present a MEMS-based sensor system, that can be used to gain information about network transparency, station safety as well as maintenance and renewal planning. Moreover, we propose an intelligent measurement scheme which adaptively selects relevant data and avoids unneeded redundancy (Smart Data instead of Big Data).}

      abstract = {As connected sensors continue to evolve, interest in low-voltage monitoring solutions is increasing. This also applies in the area of switchgear monitoring, where the detection of switch actions, their differentiation and aging are of fundamental interest. In particular, the universal applicability for various types of construction plays a major role. Methods in which design-specific features are learned in an offline training are therefore less suitable for assessing the condition of switchgears. A new computational efficient method for intelligent online feature selection is presented, which can be used to train a model for the addressed use cases on-site. Process- and design-specific features can be learned locally (e.g. on a sensor system) without the need of prior offline training. The proposed method is evaluated on four datasets of switchgear measurements, which were recorded using microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based sensors (acoustic and vibration). Furthermore, we show that the features selected by our method can be used to track changes in switching processes due to aging effects.},

This paper addresses the challenges on the industrial realization of the AI tools, considering the use case of Laser Beam Welding quality control as an example. We use object detection algorithms from the TensorFlow object detection API and adapt them to our use case using transfer learning. The baseline models we develop are used as benchmarks and evaluated and compared to models that undergo dataset scaling and hyperparameter tuning. We find that moderate scaling of the dataset via image augmentation leads to improvements in intersection over union (IoU) and recall, whereas high levels of augmentation and scaling may lead to deterioration of results. Finally, we put our results into perspective of the underlying use case and evaluate their fit.}

This allows networked cameras to associate detected body joints from nearby humans with an orientation stream from a nearby wearable; This wearable’s orientation stream can be transformed and complemented with its user’s full body pose estimates. Results show that in multi-user environments where users try to perform actions synchronously, out of 42 joint candidates, our calibration-free method obtains a perfect match within 83 to 155 samples (2.8 to 5.2 seconds), depending on the scenario.

of limited use for Deep Learning applications. This can be traced back to issues in the quality, the scope, as well as in the variability of the datasets. These limitations often lead to overfitting of  networks and thus to results that are only conditionally generalizable. One way to counteract this problem is to extend the data by using data augmentation techniques. This paper presents an algorithm and compares two augmentation strategies: (1) userwise augmentation and (2) fold-wise augmentation to extend the size of a dataset here shown on the PAMAP2 dataset, with an arbitrary number of synthetic samples. These synthesized data resemble the user- and activity-specific characteristics and fit seamlessly into the dataset. They are created by a recurrent Generative Adversarial Network, with both the generator and discriminator modeled by a set of LSTM cells to produce the synthetic time-series data. In our evaluation, we trained four DeepConvLSTM models with supervised learning, three times with a LOSO cross-validation: one baseline model and two times with additional data but different augmentation strategies, as well as one model without cross-validation that monitors the synthesized data quality. The compared augmentation strategies demonstrate the impact as well as the generalized nature of the augmented data. By increasing the size of the dataset by factor 5, we improved the F1-Score by 11.0% with strategy (1) and 5.1% with strategy (2).}

        abstract = {Background
One relevant strategy to prevent the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) focuses on increasing physical activity. The use of activity trackers by patients could enable objective measurement of their regular physical activity in daily life and promote physical activity through the use of a tracker-based intervention. This trial aims to answer three research questions: (1) Is the use of activity trackers suitable for longitudinal assessment of physical activity in everyday life? (2) Does the use of a tracker-based intervention lead to sustainable improvements in the physical activity of healthy individuals and in people with T2DM? (3) Does the accompanying digital motivational intervention lead to sustainable improvements in physical activity for participants using the tracker-based device?
Methods
The planned study is a randomized controlled trial focused on 1,642 participants with and without T2DM for 9 months with regard to their physical activity behavior. Subjects allocated to an intervention group will wear an activity tracker. Half of the subjects in the intervention group will also receive an additional digital motivational intervention. Subjects allocated to the control group will not receive any intervention. The primary outcome is the amount of moderate and vigorous physical activity in minutes and the number of steps per week measured continuously with the activity tracker and assessed by questionnaires at four time points. Secondary endpoints are medical parameters measured at the same four time points. The collected data will be analyzed using inferential statistics and explorative data-mining techniques.
Discussion
The trial uses an interdisciplinary approach with a team including sports psychologists, sports scientists, health scientists, health care professionals, physicians, and computer scientists. It also involves the processing and analysis of large amounts of data collected with activity trackers. These factors represent particular strengths as well as challenges in the study.
Trial Registration
The trial is registered at the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform via the German Clinical Studies Trial Register (DRKS), DRKS00027064. Registered on 11 November 2021.}

Previous research has investigated how to quantify hand tremor with smartphones and wearable sensors, mainly under controlled data collection conditions. Solutions for daily real-life settings remain largely underexplored. Objective: Our objective was to monitor and assess hand tremor severity in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), and to better understand the effects of PD medications in a naturalistic environment. Methods: Using the Welch method, we generated periodograms of accelerometer data and computed signal features to compare patients with varying degrees of PD symptoms. Results: We introduced and empirically evaluated the tremor intensity parameter (TIP), an accelerometer-based metric to quantify hand tremor severity in PD using smartphones. There was a statistically significant correlation between the TIP and self-assessed Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II tremor scores (Kendall rank correlation test: z=30.521, P&lt;.001, $\tau$=0.5367379; n=11). An analysis of the ``before'' and ``after'' medication intake conditions identified a significant difference in accelerometer signal characteristics among participants with different levels of rigidity and bradykinesia (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P&lt;.05). Conclusions: Our work demonstrates the potential use of smartphone inertial sensors as a systematic symptom severity assessment mechanism to monitor PD symptoms and to assess medication effectiveness remotely. Our smartphone-based monitoring app may also be relevant for other conditions where hand tremor is a prevalent symptom. ",

It promises shortened training times and increased classification results for new datasets and activity classes. However, the question of what exactly is transferred is not dealt with in detail in many of the recent publications, and it is furthermore often difficult to reproduce the presented results. Therefore we would like to contribute with this paper to the understanding of transfer learning for sensor-based human activity recognition. In our experiment use weight transfer to transfer models between two datasets, as well as between sensors from the same dataset. As source- and target- datasets PAMAP2 and Skoda Mini Checkpoint are used. The utilized network architecture is based on a DeepConvLSTM. The result of our investigation shows that transfer learning has to be considered in a very differentiated way, since the desired positive effects by applying the method depend very much on the data and also on the architecture used.},

  abstract = {Photoplethysmography is an optical measurement principle which is present in most modern wearable devices such as fitness trackers and smartwatches. As the analysis of physiological signals requires reliable but energy-efficient algorithms, suitable datasets are essential for their development, evaluation, and benchmark. A broad variety of clinical datasets is available with recordings from medical pulse oximeters which traditionally apply transmission mode photoplethysmography at the fingertip or earlobe. However, only few publicly available datasets utilize recent reflective mode sensors which are typically worn at the wrist and whose signals show different characteristics. Moreover, the recordings are often advertised as raw, but then turn out to be preprocessed and filtered while the applied parameters are not stated. In this way, the heart rate and its variability can be extracted, but interesting secondary information from the non-stationary signal is often lost. Consequently, the test of novel signal processing approaches for wearable devices usually implies the gathering of own or the use of inappropriate data. In this paper, we present a multi-varied method to analyze the suitability and applicability of presumably raw photoplethysmography signals.
We present an analytical tool which applies 7 decision metrics to characterize 10 publicly available datasets with a focus on less or ideally unfiltered, raw signals. Besides the review, we finally provide a guideline for future datasets, to suit to and to be applicable in digital signal processing, to support the development and evaluation of algorithms for resource-limited wearable devices.},

Depth cameras have also emerged as a promising modality for activity recognition as they allow detection of users’ body joints and postures. Increased resolutions have now enabled a novel use of depth cameras that facilitate more fine-grained activity descriptors: The remote detection of a person’s breathing by picking up the small distance changes from the user’s chest over time. We propose in this work a novel method to model chest elevation to robustly monitor a user’s respiration, whenever users are sitting or standing, and facing the camera. The method is robust to users occasionally blocking their torso region and is able to provide meaningful breathing features to allow classification in activity recognition tasks. We illustrate that with this method, with specific activities such as paced-breathing meditating, performing breathing exercises, or post-exercise recovery, our model delivers a breathing accuracy that matches that of a commercial respiration chest monitor belt. Results show that the breathing rate can be detected with our method at an accuracy of 92 to 97% from a distance of two metres, outperforming state-of-the-art depth imagining methods especially for non-sedentary persons, and allowing separation of activities in respiration-derived features space.},

    abstract = {PPG-based continuous heart rate monitoring is essential in a number of domains, e.g. for healthcare or fitness applications. Recently, methods based on time-frequency spectra emerged to address the challenges of motion artefact compensation. However, existing approaches are highly parametrised and optimised for specific scenarios of small public datasets. We address this fragmentation by contributing research into the robustness and generalisation capabilities of PPG-based heart rate estimation approaches. First, we introduce a novel large-scale dataset (called PPG-DaLiA), including a wide range of activities performed under close to real-life conditions. Second, we extend a state-of-the-art algorithm, significantly improving its performance on several datasets. Third, we introduce deep learning to this domain, and investigate various convolutional neural network architectures. Our end-to-end learning approach takes the time-frequency spectra of synchronised PPG- and accelerometer-signals as input, and provides the estimated heart rate as output. Finally, we compare the novel deep learning approach to classical methods, performing evaluation on four public datasets. We show that on large datasets the deep learning model significantly outperforms other methods: The mean absolute error could be reduced by 31% on the new dataset PPG-DaLiA, and by 21% on the dataset WESAD.},

The link between affective states and biophysical data, collected in lab settings, has been established successfully. However, the number of realistic studies targeting affect detection in the wild is still limited. In this paper we present an exploratory field study, using physiological data of 11 healthy subjects. We aim to classify arousal, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), stress, and valence self-reports, utilizing feature-based and CNN methods. In addition, we extend the CNNs to multi-task CNNs, classifying all labels of interest simultaneously. Comparing the F1 score averaged over the different tasks and classifiers the CNNs reach an 1.8% higher score than the classical methods. However, the F1 scores barely exceed 45%. In the light of these results, we discuss pitfalls and challenges for physiology-based affective computing in the wild.},

    abstract = {Signal segmentation is a generic task in many time series applications. We propose approaching it via Bayesian changepoint algorithms, i.e., by assigning segments between changepoints. When successive signals show a recurrent changepoint pattern, estimating changepoint recurrence is beneficial for two reasons: While recurrent changepoints yield more robust signal segment estimates, non-recurrent changepoints bear valuable information for unsupervised anomaly detection. This study introduces the changepoint recurrence distribution (CPRD) as an empirical estimate of the recurrent behavior of observed changepoints. Two generic methods for incorporating the estimated CPRD into the process of assessing recurrence of future changepoints are suggested. The knowledge of non-recurrent changepoints arising from one of these methods allows additional unsupervised anomaly detection. The quality both of changepoint recurrence estimation via CPRD and of changepoint-related signal segmentation and unsupervised anomaly detection are verified in a proof-of-concept study for two exemplary machine tool monitoring tasks.},

Affect recognition research aims to detect the affective state of a person based on observables, with the goal to, for example, provide reasoning for the person’s decision making or to support mental wellbeing (e.g., stress monitoring). Recently, beside of approaches based on audio, visual or text information, solutions relying on wearable sensors as observables, recording mainly physiological and inertial parameters, have received increasing attention. Wearable systems enable an ideal platform for long-term affect recognition applications due to their rich functionality and form factor, while providing valuable insights during everyday life through integrated sensors. However, existing literature surveys lack a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art research in wearable-based affect recognition. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a broad overview and in-depth understanding of the theoretical background, methods and best practices of wearable affect and stress recognition. Following a summary of different psychological models, we detail the influence of affective states on the human physiology and the sensors commonly employed to measure physiological changes. Then, we outline lab protocols eliciting affective states and provide guidelines for ground truth generation in field studies. We also describe the standard data processing chain and review common approaches related to the preprocessing, feature extraction and classification steps. By providing a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art and guidelines to various aspects, we would like to enable other researchers in the field to conduct and evaluate user studies and develop wearable systems.},

For the detection of anomalies in industrial settings, sensor units have been introduced to predict and classify such anomalous events, but these critically rely on annotated data for training. Lengthy data collection campaigns are needed, which tend to be combined with domain expert annotations of the data afterwards, resulting in costly and slow process. This work presents an alternative by studying live annotation of rare anomalous events in sensor streams in a real-world manufacturing setting by experienced human operators that can also observe the machinery itself. A prototype for visualization and in situ annotation of sensor signals is developed with embedded unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms to propose signals for annotation and which allows the operators to give feedback on the detection and classify anomalous events. This prototype allowed assembling a corpus of several weeks of sensor data measured in a real manufacturing surrounding and was annotated by domain experts as an evaluation basis for this study. The evaluation of live annotations reveals high user motivation after getting accustomed to the labeling prototype. After this initial period, clear anomalies with characteristic signal patterns are detected reliably in visualized envelope signals. More subtle signal deviations were less likely to be confirmed an anomaly due to either an insufficient visibility in envelope signals or the absence of characteristic signal patterns.},

Especially for time-series data, which is common in Activity Recognition, synchronizing several independently recorded sensors is challenging. Adding second level evidence, like video recordings from multiple angles and time-coded annotations, further complicates the matter of curating such data. A possible alternative is to make use of standardized multi-media formats. Sensor data can be encoded in audio format, and time-coded information, like annotations, as subtitles. Video data can be added easily. All this media can be merged into a single container file, which makes the issue of synchronization explicit. The incurred performance overhead by this encoding is shown to be negligible and compression can be applied to optimize storage and transmission overhead.},

In this chapter, we argue that each sensor modality exhibits particular statistical properties that allow to reconstruct the modality solely from the sensor data itself. In order to investigate this, tri-axial inertial sensor data from five publicly available datasets are analysed. We found that in particular three statistical properties, the mode, the kurtosis, and the number of modes tend to be sufficient for classification of sensor modality - requiring as the only assumption that the sampling rate and sample format are known, and the fact that that acceleration and magnetometer data is present in the dataset. With those assumption in place, we found that 98% of all 1003 data points were successfully classified.}

Such validation studies become challenging when recording outside the lab, over longer stretches of time. This paper presents a method that uses an inconspicuous, ear-worn device that allows the wearer to annotate his or her activities as the recording takes place. Since the ear-worn device has integrated inertial sensors, we use cross-correlation over all wearable inertial signals to propagate the annotations over all sensor streams. In a feasibility study with 7 participants performing 6 different physical activities, we show that our algorithm is able to synchronize signals between sensors worn on the body using cross-correlation, typically within a second. A comfort rating scale study has shown that attachment is critical. Button presses can thus define markers in synchronized activity data, resulting in a fast, comfortable, and reliable annotation method.},

In a focused analysis on data from three in-hospital patients with each having six to nine seizures recorded, we show that this type of seizures can manifest very differently and thus significantly impact classification. Using a Random Forest model on a rich set of features, we have obtained overall precision and recall scores of up to 0.92 and 0.72 respectively. These results show that the approach has validity, but we identify the type of focal seizure to be a critical factor for the classification performance.},

We found that weights of a neural network can either be represented by a single 4 bit power-of-two value or with two 4 bit values depending on accuracy requirements. We evaluate the classification accuracy of VGG-16 and ResNet50 on the ImageNet dataset with weights represented in our novel number format. To include a more complex task, we additionally evaluate the format on two networks for semantic segmentation. In addition, we design a novel processing element based on bit-shifts which is configurable in terms of throughput (4 bit mode) and accuracy (8 bit mode). We evaluate this processing element in an FPGA implementation of a dedicated accelerator for neural networks incorporating a 32-by-64 processing array running at 250 MHz with 1 TOp/s peak throughput in 8 bit mode. The accelerator is capable of processing regular convolutional layers and dilated convolutions in combination with pooling and upsampling. For a semantic segmentation network with 108.5 GOp/frame, our FPGA implementation achieves a throughput of 7.0 FPS in the 8 bit accurate mode and upto 11.2 FPS in the 4 bit mode corresponding to 760.1 GOp/s and 1,218 GOp/s effective throughput, respectively. Finally, we compare the novel design to classical multiplier-based approaches in terms of FPGA utilization and power consumption. Our novel multiply-accumulate engines designed for the optimized number representation uses 9 % less logical elements while allowing double throughput compared to a classical implementation. Moreover, a measurement shows 25% reduction of power consumption at same throughput. Therefore, our flexible design offers a solution to the trade-off between energy efficiency, accuracy, and high throughput.}

We conducted an Ambulatory Assessment in which 75 university students (52 females) from four study sites carried smartphones and received prompts six times a day in their everyday environments to capture information regarding momentary self-control and the presence of other individuals consuming SSBs. Multilevel models revealed a statistically significant negative association between dispositional self-control and SSB consumption. Moreover, having more self-control than usual was only beneficial in regard to lower SSB consumption frequency, when other individuals consuming SSBs were not present but not when they were present. The findings support the hypothesis that self-control is an important factor regarding SSB consumption. This early evidence highlights self-control as a candidate to design interventions to promote healthier drinking through improved self-control.}

  abstract = {In this study, we consider the problem of detecting process-related anomalies for machine tools. The similar shape of successive sensor signals, which arises due to the same process step sequence applied to each workpiece, suggests extracting shape-related features. In recent years, shapelets dominated the field of shape-related features. Unfortunately, they involve a high computational burden due to hyperparameter optimization.We introduce alternative shape-related features relying on abrupt signal changes (changepoints) reflecting the changes of process steps. During normal operation, changepoints follow a highly recurrent pattern, i.e., appear at similar locations. Thus, being able to distinguish regular, recurrent from abnormal, non-recurrent changepoints allows detecting process anomalies.For changepoint recurrence estimation, we extend the Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) method. The extension allows distinguishing normal and abnormal changepoints relying on empirical estimates of the changepoint recurrence distribution. Subsequently, changepoint-related features are introduced and compared to shapelets and wavelet-based features in a case study comprising real-world machine tool data.Qualitative results verify changepoint locations being comparable to shapelet locations found by the FLAG shapelet approach. Furthermore, quantitative results suggest superior classification performance both to shapelets and wavelet-based features.},

    abstract = {Affect recognition aims to detect a person’s affective state based on observables, with the goal to e.g. improve human-computer interaction. Long-term stress is known to have severe implications on wellbeing, which call for continuous and automated stress monitoring systems. However, the affective computing community lacks commonly used standard datasets for wearable stress detection which a) provide multimodal high-quality data, and b) include multiple affective states. Therefore, we introduce WESAD, a new publicly available dataset for wearable stress and affect detection. This multimodal dataset features physiological and motion data, recorded from both a wrist- and a chest-worn device, of 15 subjects during a lab study. The following sensor modalities are included: blood volume pulse, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electromyogram, respiration, body temperature, and three- axis acceleration. Moreover, the dataset bridges the gap between previous lab studies on stress and emotions, by containing three different affective states (neutral, stress, amusement). In addition, self-reports of the subjects, which were obtained using several established questionnaires, are contained in the dataset. Furthermore, a benchmark is created on the dataset, using well-known features and standard machine learning methods.

In the binary case (stress vs. non-stress), accuracies of up to 93 % were reached. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis and comparison of the two device locations (chest vs. wrist) as well as the different sensor modalities.},

    abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors have become a prevalent feature included in current wearables, as the cost and sizeof current PPG modules have dropped significantly. Research in the analysis of PPG data has recently expanded beyond the fast and accurate characterization of heart rate, into the adaptive handling of artifacts within the signal and even the capturing of respiration rate. In this paper, we instead explore using state-of-the-art PPG sensor modules for long-term wearable deployment and the observation of trends over minutes, rather than seconds. By focusing specifically on lowering the sampling rate and via analysis of the spectrum of frequencies alone, our approach minimizes the costly illumination-based sensing and can be used to detect the dominant frequencies of heart rate and respiration rate, but also enables to infer on activity of the sympathetic nervous system. We show in two experiments that such detections and measurements can still be achieved at low sampling rates down to10 Hz, within a power-efficient platform. This approach enables miniature sensor designs that monitor average heart rate, respiration rate, and sympathetic nerve activity over longer stretches of time.},

    abstract = {Affect recognition aims to detect a person’s affective state based on observables, with the goal to e.g. provide reasoning for decision making or support mental wellbeing. Recently, besides approaches based on audio, visual or text information, solutions relying on wearable sensors as observables (recording mainly physiological and inertial parameters) have received increasing attention. Wearable systems offer an ideal platform for long-term affect recognition applications due to their rich functionality and form factor. However, existing literature lacks a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art research in wearable-based affect recognition. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a broad overview and in-depth understanding of the theoretical background, methods, and best practices of wearable affect and stress recognition. We summarise psychological models, and detail affect-related physiological changes and their measurement with wearables. We outline lab protocols eliciting affective states, and provide guidelines for ground truth generation in field studies. We also describe the standard data processing chain, and review common approaches to preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. By providing a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art and guidelines to various aspects, we would like to enable other researchers in the field of affect recognition to conduct and evaluate user studies and develop wearable systems.},

Analysis of basketball games usually focuses on the locations of players at particular points in the game, whereas the capture of what actions the players were performing remains underrepresented. In this paper, we present an approach that allows to monitor players' actions during a game, such as dribbling, shooting, blocking, or passing, with wrist-worn inertial sensors. In a feasibility study, inertial data from a sensor worn on the wrist were recorded during training and game sessions from three players. We illustrate that common features and classifiers are able to recognize short actions, with overall accuracy performances around 83.6% (k-Nearest-Neighbor) and 87.5% (Random Forest). Some actions, such as jump shots, performed well (± 95% accuracy), whereas some types of dribbling achieving low (± 44%) recall.},

It is however to date not clear, what factors might hinder the application of this technology in any setting, what areas of the torso need to be observed, and how readings are affected for persons at larger distances from the RGB-D camera. In this paper, we present a benchmark dataset that consists of the point cloud data from a depth camera, which monitors 7 volunteers at variable distances, for variable methods to pin-point the person's torso, and at variable breathing rates. Our findings show that the respiration signal's signal-to-noise ratio becomes debilitating as the distance to the person approaches 4 metres, and that bigger windows over the person's chest work particularly well. The sampling rate of the depth camera was also found to impact the signal's quality significantly. },

Consequently, we present a data glove prototype comprising a glove-embedded gesture classifier utilizing data from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in the fingertips. In an extensive set of experiments with 57 participants, our system was tested with 22 hand gestures, all taken from the French Sign Language (LSF) alphabet.

Our approach has also been compared to the local fusion algorithm on an IMU motion sensor, showing faster settling times and less delays after gesture changes. Real-time performance of the recognition is shown to occur within 63 milliseconds, allowing fluent use of the gestures via Bluetooth-connected systems.},

To evaluate the performance of unsupervised algorithms, the automatically-generated marks are compared to human expert-created labels on two publicly-available datasets.

Recent standardization efforts focus on exploiting slow channel hopping while properly scheduling the transmissions to provide a strict Quality of Service for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). By keeping nodes time-synchronized and by employing a channel hopping approach, IEEE 802.15.4-TSCH (Time-Slotted Channel Hoping) aims at providing high-level network reliability. For this, however, we need to construct an accurate schedule, able to exploit reliable paths. In particular, radio links with high Packet Error Rate should not be exploited since they are less energy-efficient (more retransmissions are required) and they negatively impact the reliability. In this work, we take advantage of the continuously advertisement packets transmitted by the nodes to infer the link quality. We argue that the reception rate of broadcast packets provide means to estimate the link quality to different neighbors, even when the data packets use different, collision-free transmission opportunities. Our experiments on a large-scale platform highlight that our approach improves the convergence delay, identifying the best routes to the sink during the bootstrapping (or reconverging) phase without adding any extra control packet.}

At best, digital slides tend to be combined with audio, while video footage of the presenter's body language often turns out to be either too sensitive, occluded, or hard to achieve for common lighting conditions. If presentations require capturing what is written on the whiteboard, more expensive setups are usually needed. In this paper, we present an approach that complements the data from a wrist-worn inertial sensor with depth camera footage, to obtain an accurate posture representation of the presenter. A wearable inertial measurement unit complements the depth footage by providing more accurate arm rotations and wrist postures when the depth images are occluded, whereas the depth images provide an accurate full-body posture for indoor environments. In an experiment with 10 volunteers, we show that posture estimates from depth images and inertial sensors complement each other well, resulting in far less occlusions and tracking of the wrist with an accuracy that supports capturing sketches.},

  abstract = {Today’s demands regarding workpiece quality in cutting machine tool processing require automated monitoring of both machine condition and the cutting process. Currently, best-performing monitoring approaches rely on high-frequency acoustic emission (AE) sensor data and definition of advanced features, which involve complex computations. This approach is challenging for machine monitoring via embedded sensor systems with constrained computational power and energy budget. To cope with constrained energy, we rely on data recording with microelectromechanical system (MEMS) vibration sensors, which rely on lower-frequency sampling. To clarify whether these lower-frequency signals bear information for typical machine monitoring prediction tasks, we evaluate data for the most generic machine monitoring task of tool condition monitoring (TCM). To cope with computational complexity of advanced features, we introduce two intelligent preprocessing algorithms. First, we split non-stationary signals of recurrent structure into similar segments. Then, we identify most discriminative spectral differences in the segmented signals that allow for best separation of classes for the given TCM task. Subsequent feature extraction only in most relevant signal segments and spectral regions enables high expressiveness even for simple features. Extensive evaluation of the outlined approach on multiple data sets of different combinations of cutting machine tools, tool types and workpieces confirms its sensibility. Intelligent preprocessing enables reliable identification of stationary segments and most discriminative frequency bands. With subsequent extraction of simple but tailor-made features in these spectral-temporal regions of interest (RoIs), TCM typically framed as multi feature classification problem can be converted to a single feature threshold comparison problem with an average F1 score of 97.89%. },

We propose a novel body-coupled communication approach that simplifies the physical layer of data transmission via capacitive coupling between wearable systems with conductive fabrics: This layer provides a stable reference potential for the feedback path in proximity to the attached wearables on the human body, to cancel the erratic dependency on the environmental ground, and to increase the communications' reliability. Evaluation of our prototype shows significant increases in signal quality, due to reduced attenuation and noise. Requirements on hardware and, subsequently, energy consumption, cost, and implementation effort are reduced as well.},

This paper presents a system that estimates individual procedure transitions from the user's physical movement and gestures recorded with inertial motion sensors. This is combined with egocentric or external video recordings, allowing for an efficient review of video archives. We investigate different clustering algorithms on wearable inertial sensor data recorded on par with video data, to automatically create transition marks between task steps. The goal is to match these marks to the transitions given in a description of the workflow, thus creating navigation cues to browse video repositories of manual work. To evaluate the performance of unsupervised clustering algorithms, the automatically generated marks are compared to human-expert created labels on publicly available datasets. Additionally, we tested the approach on a novel data set in a manufacturing lab environment, describing an existing sequential manufacturing process.},

Several sensing modalities have been suggested to identify handheld objects, from wrist-worn RFID readers to cameras. A critical obstacle to using such sensors, however, is that they tend to be too power hungry for continuous usage. This paper proposes a system that detects grasping using first inertial sensors and then Electromyography (EMG) on the forearm, to then selectively activate the object identification sensors. This three-tiered approach would therefore only attempt to identify in-hand objects once it is known a grasping has occurred. Our experiments show that high recall can be obtained for grasp detection, 95% on average across participants, with the grasping of lighter and smaller objects clearly being more difficult.},

Utilizing active infrared distance sensing or sensing magnetic flux, it is possible to measure water consumption with an accuracy below 0.1l on commonly installed meters. With a continuous power consumption (assuming a daily water consumption of 2 hours) of less than 20 mW, the system can be provide real-time feedback to home-owners, office workers and people sharing such a retro-fitted water supply.},

Interaction with mobile devices is still mainly limited to visual output and tactile finger-based input. Despite the visions of next-generation mobile interaction, the hand-held form factor hinders new interaction techniques becoming commonplace. In contrast, wearable devices and sensors are intended for more continuous and close-to-body use. This makes it possible to design novel wearable-augmented mobile interaction methods – both explicit and implicit. For example, the EEG signal from a wearable breast strap could be used to identify user status and change the device state accordingly (implicit) and the optical tracking with a head-mounted camera could be used to recognize gestural input (explicit). In this paper, the authors outline the design space for how the existing and envisioned wearable devices and sensors could augment mobile interaction techniques. Based on designs and discussions in a recently organized workshop on the topic as well as other related work, the authors present an overview of this design space and highlight some use cases that underline the potential therein.},

Thus people can reflect on their actions in a new way. We work on the topic of wearable activity recognition in an interdisciplinary way, both with a theoretical analytic direction and a concrete system design perspective. The theoretical part of this article is about understanding how people relate to their actions using an activity recognition lifelogging device. It is based on the philosophical theory of action. For the concrete design perspective of wearable activity recognition, we introduce two cases from our current design practice. We bridge the theoretical thoughts and the practical perspective by introducing the (critical) design theory. Based on that, opportunity and limits for self-tracking and self-reflection are the results of the interdisciplinary approach.}

A possible alternative is to make use of standardized multi- media formats. Sensor data can be encoded in audio for- mat, and time-coded information, like annotations, as sub- titles. Video data can be added easily. All this media can be merged into a single container file, which makes the is- sue of synchronization explicit. The incurred performance overhead by this encoding is shown to be negligible and compression can be applied to optimize storage and trans- mission overhead.},

This paper investigates the impact of using such chips that are not only smaller and cheaper as their predecessors, but also come with an arsenal of extra processing and detection capabilities, built in the sensor package. A case study with accompanying experiments using two MEMS accelerometers, show that using these capabilities can cause significant reductions in resources for data acquisition, and could even support basic recognition tasks.}

Similarly, the information retrieval capabilities inside a laboratory are limited to traditional computing interfaces, which due to safety regulations are sometimes not usable at all. In this paper, Google Glass is combined with a wrist-worn gesture sensor to support Wetlab experimenters. Taking "in-situ" documentation while an experiment is performed, as well as contextualizing the protocol at hand can be implemented on top of the proposed system. After an analysis of current practices and needs through a series of explorative deployments in wet labs, we motivate the need for a wearable hands-free system, and introduce our specific design to guide experimenters. Finally, using a study with 22 participants evaluating the system on a benchmark DNA extraction experiment, we explore the use of gesture recognition for enabling the system to track where the user might be in the experiment. },

However, in WSNs the operating conditions and/or user requirements are often desired to be evolvable, whether driven by changes of the monitored parameters or WSN properties. To this end, few sensor nodes sample the phenomenon and transmit the acquired samples, typically multihop, to the application through a gateway called sink. Accurately representing the physical phenomenon and reliably, timely delivering the user required information comes at the cost of higher energy as additional messages are required. This work proposes a tunable co-design for network optimization to avoid under or over provision of information and interaction of the attributes and their effects on each other. We validate the approach viability through analytical modeling, simulations for a range of requirements.},

This paper focuses on the use of a wrist-watch with integrated inertial sensors. The algorithms that deal with the data from these sensors can automatically detect the activities that the patient performed from characteristic motion patterns. Such a system can be deployed for several weeks continuously and can thus provide the consulting psychiatrist an insight in their patient's behavior and changes thereof. Since these algorithms will never be flawless, however, a remaining question is how we can support the psychiatrist in assigning confidence to these automatic detections. To this end, we present a study where visualizations at three levels from a detection algorithm are used as feedback, and examine which of these are the most helpful in conveying what activities the patient has performed. Results show that just visualizing the classifier's output performs the best, but that user's confidence in these automated predictions can be boosted significantly by visualizing earlier pre-processing steps.},

 abstract = {In the participatory sensing model, humans may serve as opportunistic sensors and flexible actuators while also consuming sensing services. Integrating humans into sensing systems has the potential to increase scale and reduce costs. However, contemporary participatory sensing software provides poor consideration of user dynamism, which includes: mobility across networks, mobility across devices and context-awareness. To address these limitations we propose the User Component and User Bindings. The former represents the user as a first class reconfigurable element of evolving and shared participatory sensing platforms. The latter allows the middleware to support multiple communications channels including Online Social Networks (OSN) to connect users with sensing applications. Our approach increases user participation, reduces out-of-context interactions and only consumes a limited amount of energy by sharing context information between applications. We support these claims by evaluating our approach on a two weeks experiment in which three participants take part in three concurrent participatory applications.},

We use an interdisciplinary approach, combining general philosophical assumptions on the mediating character of technology with the current computer science design practice. Wearable activity recognition is about computer systems which automatically detect human actions. Of special relevance for our research project are applications using wearable activity recognition for self-tracking and self-reflection, for instance by tracking personal activity data like sports. We assume that activity recognition is providing a new perspective on human actions; this perspective is mediated by the recognition process, which includes the recognition models and algorithms chosen by the designer, and the visualization to the user. We analyze this mediating character with two concepts which are both based on phenomenological thoughts namely first Peter-Paul Verbeek’s theory on human-technology relations and second the ideas of embodied interaction. Embedded in the concepts is a direction which leads to the role of technical design in how technology mediates. Regarding this direction, we discuss two case studies, both in the possible using practice of self-tracking and the design practice. This paper ends with prospects towards a better design, how the technologies should be designed to support self-reflection in a valuable and responsible way.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we will provide a typology of sensor-based activity recognition and interaction, which we call wearable activity recognition. The typology will focus on a conceptual level regarding the relation between persons and computing systems. Two paradigms, first the activity based seamless and obtrusive interaction and second activity-tracking for reflection, are seen as predominant. The conceptual approach will lead to the key term of this technology research, which is currently underexposed in a wider and conceptual understanding: human action/activity. Modeling human action as a topic for human-computer interaction (HCI) in general exists since its beginning. We will apply two classic theories which are influential in the HCI research to the application of wearable activity recognition. It is both a survey and a critical reflection on these concepts. As a further goal of our approach, we argue for the relevance and the benefits this typology can have. Beside practical consequences, a typology of the human-computer relation and the discussion of the key term activity can be a medium for exchange which other disciplines. Especially when applications become more serious, for example in health care, a typology including a wider mutual understanding can be useful for cooperations with non-technical practitioners e.g. doctors or psychologists.},

        ABSTRACT={This article explores properties and suitability of mobile and wearable platforms for continuous activity recognition and monitoring. Mobile phones have become generic computing platforms, and even though they might not always be with the user, they are increasingly easy to develop for and have an unmatched variety of on-board sensors. Wearable units in contrast tend to be purpose-built, and require a certain degree of user adaptation, but they are increasingly used to do continuous sensing. We explore the trade-offs for both device types in a study that compares their sensor data and that explicitly examines how often these devices are being worn by the user. To this end, we have recorded a dataset from 51 participants, who were given a wrist-worn sensor and an app to be used on their Smartphone for two weeks continuously, totalling 638 days (or over 15300 hours) of wearable and mobile data. Results confirm findings of previous studies from North America and show that Smartphones are on average being on their user less than 23\% of the time, mostly during working hours. Just as noteworthy is the high variance in Smartphone use (in carrying, interacting with, and charging the phone) among participants.}

In this work, we present a novel solution that discovers occurrences of prototypical ’ego network’ patterns from social media and mobile-phone networks, to provide a data-driven instrument to be used in behavioral sciences for graph interpretations. We analyze nine datasets gathered from social media websites and mobile phones, together with 13 network measures, and three unsupervised clustering algorithms. Further, we use an unsupervised feature similarity technique to reduce redundancy and extract compact features from the data. The reduced feature subsets are then used to discover ego patterns using various clustering techniques. By cluster analysis, we discover that eight distinct ego neighborhood patterns or ego graphs have emerged. This categorization allows concise analysis of users’ data as they change over time. We provide fine-grained analysis for the validity and quality of clustering results. We perform clustering verification based on the following three intuitions: i) analyzing the clustering patterns for the same set of users crawled from three social media networks, ii) associating metadata information with the clusters and evaluating their performance on real networks, iii) studying selected participants over an extended period to analyze their behavior.},

We illustrate the requirements for such middleware with three different healthcare applications that were deployed with our middleware solution, and characterize the performance with energy consumption, overhead caused for the smartphone, and processing time under real-world circumstances. Results show that with sensing-intensive applications, our solution only minimally impacts the phone's resources, with an added CPU utilization of 3/% and a memory usage under 7 MB. Furthermore, for a minimum message delivery ratio of 99.9\%, up to 12 sensor readings per second are guaranteed to be handled, regardless of the number of applications using our middleware.}

A substantial amount of wearable sensing products have been introduced to the market for just this reason, detecting whether the user is either sleeping or awake. Assessing these devices for their accuracy in estimating sleep is a daunting task, as their hardware design tends to be different and many are closed-source systems that have not been clinically tested. In this paper, we present a challenging benchmark dataset from an open source wrist-worn data logger that contains relatively high-frequent (100Hz) 3D inertial data from 42 sleep lab patients, along with their data from clinical polysomnography. We analyse this dataset with two traditional approaches for detecting sleep and wake states and propose a new algorithm specifically for 3D acceleration data, Estimation of Stationary Sleep-segments (ESS). Results show that all three methods generally over-estimate for sleep, with our method performing slightly better (74\% overall mean accuracy) than the traditional activity count-based methods.},

abstract = {Over the last years different wearable electronic devices, technically similar to smart phones, have become available in the form factor of watches and glasses. However, including wearable sensing, actuation, and communication technologies directly into garments is still a great challenge. Cloths offer the chance to unobtrusively integrate new functionalities. Nevertheless, it is essential to take into account that garments and cloths are fundamentally different from electronic devices. Manufacturing processes for fabrics and cloths, drivers for fashion, and user expectation with regard to comfort and durability are not comparable to classical electronic devices. In smart watches and glasses applications resemble common smart phone functionality (e.g., picture taking, (instant) messaging, voice communication, presentation of reminders) with new input and output channels. In contrast to this, new possibilities for sensing, actuation, and interaction are opening entirely new applications on garments. These new applications are needed to be identified and will then again drive the advances in smart garments. In this workshop, we focus on novel applications for garments. We discuss underlying abstraction layers that allow developers to create applications that are independent from a specific garment and that can be used with different garments. Furthermore, we invite research contributions and position statements on sensing and actuation as the basic mechanisms for smart garments. Overall the workshop aims at improving our understanding of the fundamental challenges when wearable computing moves beyond accessories into garments.},

 abstract={The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a popular middleware that eases the design, implementation, and maintenance of robot systems. In particular, ROS enables the integration of a large number of heterogeneous devices in a single system. To allow these devices to communicate and cooperate, ROS requires device-specific interfaces to be available. This restricts the number of devices that can effectively be integrated in a ROS-based system. In this work we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a ROS middleware client that allows to integrate constrained devices like wireless sensor nodes in a ROS-based system. Wireless sensor nodes embedded in the environment in which a robot system is operating can indeed help robots in navigating and interacting with the environment. The client has been implemented for devices running the Contiki operating system but its design can be readily extended to other systems like, e.g., TinyOS. Our evaluation shows that: in-buffer processing of ROS messages without relying on dynamic memory allocation is possible; message contents can be accessed conveniently using well-known concepts of the C language (structs) with negligible processing overhead with respect to a C++-based client; and that ROS' message-passing abstraction facilitates the integration of devices running event-based systems like Contiki.},

We examine using such statistical information combined with mobile acceleration data to determine 11 activities.

In this paper, we present an event-driven middleware for on-body and ambient sensor networks that allows multiple applications to define information types of their interest in a publish/subscribe manner. Incoming sensor data is hereby transformed into the desired data representation which lifts the burden of adapting the application with respect to the connected sensors off the developers shoulders. Furthermore, an unsupervised on-the-fly reloading of transformation rules from a remote server allows the systems adaptation to future applications and sensors at run-time. Application-specific event channels provide tailor-made information retrieval as well as control over the dissemination of critical information. The system is evaluated based on an Android implementation, with transformation rules implemented as OSGi bundles that are retrieved from a remote web server. Evaluation shows a low impact of running the transformation rules on a phone and highlights the reduced energy consumption by having fewer sensors serving multiple applications. It also points out the behavior and limits of the application-specific event channels and the event transformation with respect to CPU utilization, delivery ratio, and memory usage. },

A real-world feasibility study with 11 frequently-smoking participants investigates the deployment and adoption of the system, showing that smokers are generally unaware of their daily smoking patterns, and tend to overestimate their consumption. },

However, manual finger- printing techniques that split the indoor environment into pre-defined grids are implicitly bounding the maximum achievable localization accuracy. WoLF, our proposed Wireless localization and Laser-scanner assisted Fingerprinting system, solves this problem by automating the way indoor fingerprint maps are generated. We furthermore show that WiFi local- ization on the generated high resolution maps can be performed by sparse reconstruction which exploits the peculiarities imposed by the physical characteristics of indoor environments. Particularly, we propose a Bayesian Compressed Sensing (BCS) approach in order to find the position of the mobile user and dynamically determine the sufficient number of APs required for accurate positioning. BCS employs a Bayesian formalism in order to reconstruct a sparse signal using an undetermined system of equations. Experimental results with real data collected in a university building validate WoLF in terms of localization accuracy under actual environ- mental conditions. },

To alleviate this procedure and optimize classification performance, the use of time use surveys has been suggested: These large databases contain typically several days worth of detailed activity information from a large population of hundreds of thousands of participants. This paper uses a strategy first suggested by Partridge in 2008 that utilizes time use diaries in an activity recognition method. We offer a comparison of the aforementioned North-American data with a large European database, showing that although there are several cultural differences, certain important features are shared between both regions. By cross-validating across the 5160 households in this new data with activity data of 13798 individuals, especially distinctive features turn out to be time and participant{\textquoteright}s location. },

        abstract = {Users share a lot of personal information with friends, family members, and colleagues via social networks. Surprisingly, some users  choose to share their sleeping patterns, perhaps both for awareness as well as a sense of connection to others. Indeed, sharing basic sleep  data, whether a person has gone to bed or waking up, informs others about not just one‚Äôs sleeping routines but also indicates physical state,  and reflects a sense of wellness. We present Somnometer, a social alarm clock for mobile phones that helps users to capture and share their  sleep patterns. While the sleep rating is obtained from explicit user input, the sleep duration is estimated based on monitoring a user‚Äôs  interactions with the app. Observing that many individuals currently utilize their mobile phone as an alarm clock revealed behavioral  patterns that we were able to leverage when designing the app. We assess whether it is possible to reliably monitor one‚Äôs sleep duration  using such apps. We further investigate whether providing users with the ability to track their sleep behavior over a long time period can  empower them to engage in healthier sleep habits. We hypothesize that sharing sleep information with social networks impacts awareness  and connectedness among friends. The result from a controlled study reveals that it is feasible to monitor a user‚Äôs sleep duration based just  on her interactions with an alarm clock app on the mobile phone. The results from both an in-the-wild study and a controlled experiment  suggest that providing a way for users to track their sleep behaviors increased user awareness of sleep patterns and induced healthier habits.  However, we also found that, given the current broadcast nature of existing social networks, users were concerned with sharing their sleep  patterns indiscriminately. },

This approach is of particular interest for wireless sensor networks as it promises to reduce wireless traffic significantly, as only events need to be transmitted instead of potentially large chunks of inertial data. The presented approach characterizes the essence of an event's signal by combining several simple features on low-cost MEMS inertial data. Using a scenario and real data from vibration signatures generated by passing trains, we show how with this approach the classification and the estimation of length for passing trains is possible on miniature nodes placed near the railroad tracks. Experiments show that, at the cost of slightly more local processing, the chosen features produce good train type classification with up to 90\% of trains correctly identified. },

This radiomap is then searched during the position determination phase to estimate another nodes location. Usually the radiomap is build manually, either by users pin-pointing their location on a ready-made floorplan or by moving in pre-specified patterns while scanning the network for RSSI values. This cumbersome process leads to inaccuracies in the radiomap. Here, we propose a system to build the indoor- and radio-map simultaneously by using a handheld mapping system employing a laser scanner in an IEEE802.15.4-compatible network.

Smoking cessation, the only mean to avoid these serious risks, is hindered by the ease to ignore these risks in day-to-day life. In this paper we present a feasibility study with smokers wearing an accelerometer device on their wrist over the course of a week to detect their smoking habits based on detecting typical gestures carried out while smoking a cigarette. We provide a basic detection method that identifies when the user is smoking, with the goal of building a system that provides an individualized risk estimation to increase awareness and motivate smoke cessation. Our basic method detects a typical smoking gestures with a precision of 51.2\% and a user specific recall of over 70\% - creating evidence that an unobtrusive wrist- worn sensor can detect smoking. },

Three types of issues are highlighted that arose during the deployment, which impact middleware design in particular: 1) How can the architecture cope with different levels of data fidelity and propagate those levels to the applications? 2) What is the optimal way to handle temporary disconnections from sensors? and 3) How should the middleware implement sensor-specific peculiarities? Although these issues are described using a specific and demanding health care scenario, we argue that the underlying causes tend to be archetypal for a generic set of sensor network middleware. Awareness of these problem categories and possible solutions are therefore generally relevant for other researchers working on middleware designs for all kinds of sensor networks.},

In a second scenario typical sleep patterns for either working or weekend days are modeled. In a continuous experiment over 141 days (6 months), sleeping behavior is characterized by four main features: the amount of motion detected by the sensor during sleep, the duration of sleep, and the falling asleep and waking up times. Prediction of these values can be used in behavioral sleep analysis and beyond, as a component in healthcare systems. },

Another well-published type of application aims at spotting sporadic events, such as sudden rises in temperature or the presence of methane, which are tackled by detection on the individual nodes. This paper focuses on a zone between these two types of applications, where phenomena that cannot be detected on the nodes need to be observed by relatively long sequences of sensor samples. An algorithm that stems from data mining is proposed that abstracts the raw sensor data on the node into smaller packet sizes, thereby minimizing the network traffic and keeping the essence of the information embedded in the data. Experiments show that, at the cost of slightly more processing power on the node, our algorithm performs a shape abstraction of the sensed time series which, depending on the nature of the data, can extensively reduce network traffic and nodes{\textquoteright} power consumption. },

Experiments show that it is feasible to detect nightly sleep periods with a combination of light and simple motion and posture sensors, and to detect within these segments what basic sleeping postures the user assumes. These find- ings can be of value in several domains, such as monitoring of sleep apnea disorders, and support the feasibility of a continuous home-monitoring of sleeping trends where users wear the sensor device uninterruptedly for weeks to months in a row. },

There is however high interest in recognizing very short activities as well, such as pushing and pulling an oil stick or opening an oil container as sub-tasks of checking the oil level in a car. This paper presents a method for the latter type of activity recognition using start and end postures (short fixed positions of the wrist) in order to identify segments of interest in a continuous data stream. Experiments show high discriminative power for using postures to recognize short activities in continuous recordings. Additionally, classifications using postures and HMMs for recognition are combined. },

Hence our networking concept entails augmentation of such surfaces with conductive material to enable them as communication medium. It further incorporates the use of simple pushpin-connectors through which objects can be attached to network-enabled surfaces. Thereby users are provided with a highly familiar mechanism for adding objects ad hoc to the bus network, hence its name Pin&amp;Play. This paper describes the architecture and principles of Pin&amp;Play, as well as the design and implementation of a smart notice-board as proof of concept. },

        abstract = {Load sensing is a mature and robust technology widely applied in process control. In this paper we consider the use of load sensing in everyday environments as an approach to acquisition of contextual information in ubiquitous computing applications. Since weight is an intrinsic property of all physical objects, load sensing is an intriguing concept on the physical-virtual boundary, enabling the inclusive use of arbitrary objects in ubiquitous applications. In this paper we aim to demonstrate that load sensing is a versatile source of contextual information. Using a series of illustrative experiments we show that using load sensing techniques we can obtain not just weight information, but object position and interaction events on a given surface. We describe the incorporation of load-sensing in the furniture and the floor of a living laboratory environment, and report on a number of applications that use context information derived from load sensing. },

A major challenge for such interfaces is to preserve accustomed uses while providing unobtrusive access to new services. In this paper we discuss augmentation of common surfaces such as tables as generic pointing device. The basic concept is to sense the load, the load changes and the patterns of change observed on a surface using embedded load sensors. We describe the interaction model used to derive pointing actions from basic sensor observations, and detail the technical augmentation of two ordinary tables that we used for our experiments. The technology effectively emulates a serial mouse, and our implementation and use experience prove that it is unobtrusive, robust, and both intuitively and reliably usable.},

In the article the relation between a real-world situation and the data read by sensors is discussed; furthermore, an analysis of available sensing technology is given. Then we introduce an architecture that supports the transformation from sensor data to cues then to contexts as a foundation to make context-aware applications. The article suggests a method to build context-aware devices; the method starts from situation analysis, offers a structured way for selection of sensors, and finally suggests steps to determine recognition and abstraction methods. In the final part of the article the question of how this influences the applications is raised and the areas of user interfaces, communication, and proactive application scheduling are identified. We conclude with the description of a case study where a mobile phone was made aware of its environment using different sensors. The profile settings of the phone (ringing mode etc.) are automatically selected according to the real world situation the phone is used in.},

Achieving automatic context detection, usually by analysis of small hardware sensors, is a fundamental problem in human-computer interaction. However, mapping the sensor data to a context is a difficult problem involving near real-time classification and training of patterns out of noisy sensor signals. This paper proposes an adaptive approach that uses a Kohonen Self-Organizing Map, augmented with on-line k-means clustering for classification of the incoming sensor data. Overwriting of prototypes on the map, especially during the untangling phase of the Self-Organizing Map, is avoided by a refined k-means clustering of labeled input vectors.},

This requires an adaptive recognition of the activities where the user, instead of the designer, can teach the device what he/she is doing. As a case study we connected a pair of pants with accelerometers to a laptop to interpret the raw sensor data. Using a combination of machine learning techniques such as Kohonen maps and probabilistic models, we build a system that is able to learn activities while requiring minimal user attention. This approach to context awareness is more universal since it requires no a priori knowledge about the contexts or the user. },

    author={Van Laerhoven, Kristof},
    abstract={Along with the sales-figures and the popularity of wearable and portable devices, the importance of their usability and functionality is increasing as well. Most of these devices need to change their behavior according to the context they are currently in. Inadequate knowledge about the context results in a lack of user-friendliness. Mobile phones for example don?t know when and how to disturb their users when a call arrives. The solution would be to add various sensors and thus give the host device more knowledge about its context. However, the way humans describe contexts is not by giving the complete inventory of their sensations. Often, either unusual elements ("It is cold.") or more abstract properties ("I am home.", "I am in a dark room." ) are noticed and expressed. If the device needs to function in a transparent way for its user or if the user needs to train the device, it needs to recognize contexts in a similar way. This thesis will focus on the transformation of a multitude of sensory information to a short context description, supplied by the user, in an adaptive and on-line way. The approach is to use an adaptive hybrid system consisting of a connectionist layer, followed by a symbolic layer. Sensor outputs will be periodically sent to a self-organizing artificial neural network architecture, which is responsible for the initial processing and clustering. A symbolic layer, implemented as a Markov chain, provides a predictive component that enables interaction with the user, ensures an enhanced recognition.},

In this work we propose a layered real-time architecture for this kind of context-aware adaptation based on redundant collections of low-level sensors. Two kinds of sensors are distinguished: physical and logical sensors, which give cues from environment parameters and host information. A prototype board that consists of eight sensors was built for experimentation. The contexts are derived from cues using real-time recognition software, which was constructed after experiments with Kohonen{\textquoteright}s Self-Organizing Maps and its variants. A personal digital assistant (PDA) and a mobile phone were used with the prototype to demonstrate situational awareness. On the PDA font size and backlight were changed depending on the demonstrated contexts while in mobile phone the active user profile was changed. The experiments have shown that it is feasible to recognize contexts using sensors and that context information can be used to create new interaction metaphors.},
