					Our research targets an emerging generation of small and embedded
					computing systems that are equipped with basic processing and sensing
					modules, thus enabling them to detect, monitor, react on, and learn
					phenomena around them. We are particularly interested in obtaining
					multiple simple (and as a result more challenging to use) sensor
					signals within low-power devices, rather than solutions that focus on
					few high-quality signals that tend to be more expensive, complex,
					and/or fragile.
