                    You have reached the unofficial website under construction
                    of the Ubiquitous Computing group, part of the School for
                    Science and Technology at the University of Siegen in
                    Germany.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our research targets an emerging generation of small and
                    embedded computing systems that are equipped with basic
                    processing and sensing modules, thus enabling them to
                    detect, monitor, react on, and learn phenomena around them.
                    We are particularly interested in obtaining multiple simple
                    (and as a result more challenging to use) sensor signals
                    within low-power devices, rather than solutions that focus
                    on few high-quality signals that tend to be more expensive,
                    complex, and/or fragile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The focus lies especially in the learning algorithms and
                    software models that need to be built on these small
                    computer units, in order to process and characterize the
                    sensors' output, although we also tend to design and build
                    custom sensor hardware ourselves for these systems as well.
