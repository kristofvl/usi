			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>
				In our research [1], we highlight the importance of benchmarking
				algorithms on actual raw signals from reflective mode
				photoplethysmography (PPG). To demonstrate and evaluate the impact of
				preprocessing on pulse peak positions and the performance of peak
				detection algorithms, an expert rater manually annotated the peak labels
				to serve as ground truth for the publicly available dataset of Biagetti
				et al. [2]. We encourage researchers to use the dataset of raw PPG
				signals in combination with the supplementary annotations from our
				research [1] to benchmark their own algorithms as well as machine
				learning approaches. Provided as serialized Python Pickle *.p and
				comma-separated values *.csv, the annotation files of the 21806
				diastolic pulse onset labels are available for download below.
