				PPG-based continuous heart rate monitoring is essential in a number of
				domains, e.g. for healthcare or fitness applications. Recently, methods
				based on time-frequency spectra emerged to address the challenges of
				motion artefact compensation. However, existing approaches are highly
				parametrised and optimised for specific scenarios of small public
				datasets. We address this fragmentation by contributing research into
				the robustness and generalisation capabilities of PPG-based heart rate
				estimation approaches. First, we introduce a novel large-scale dataset
				(called PPG-DaLiA), including a wide range of activities performed under
				close to real-life conditions. Second, we extend a state-of-the-art
				algorithm, significantly improving its performance on several datasets.
				Third, we introduce deep learning to this domain, and investigate
				various convolutional neural network architectures. Our end-to-end
				learning approach takes the time-frequency spectra of synchronised PPG-
				and accelerometer-signals as input, and provides the estimated heart
				rate as output. Finally, we compare the novel deep learning approach to
				classical methods, performing evaluation on four public datasets. We
				show that on large datasets the deep learning model significantly
				outperforms other methods: The mean absolute error could be reduced by
				31% on the new dataset PPG-DaLiA, and by 21% on the dataset WESAD.
