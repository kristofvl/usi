				Wearable sensing systems, through their proximity with their user, can
				be used to automatically infer the wearer’s activity to obtain detailed
				information on availability, behavioural patterns and health. For this
				purpose, classifiers need to be designed and evaluated with sufficient
				training data from these sensors and from a representative set of users,
				which requires starting this procedure from scratch for every new
				sensing system and set of activities. To alleviate this procedure and
				optimize classification performance, the use of time use surveys has
				been suggested: These large databases contain typically several days
				worth of detailed activity information from a large population of
				hundreds of thousands of participants. In this project we use a strategy
				first suggested by Partridge and Golle [1] that utilizes time use
				diaries in an activity recognition method. We offer an evaluation of the
				German Time Use database, showing that certain important features could
				be useful for activity recognition. By cross-validating across the 5160
				households in this new data with activity episodes of 13798 individuals,
				especially distinctive features turn out to be time and participant’s
				location. The scripts used in this study can be obtained to be used on
				the German Time Use Study from 2001/2002. Further details can be found
				in the paper.<br />
