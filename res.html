							>P05 - Social Interaction in Semi-Automated Road Traffic</a
						>
					</h3>
					How does the increasing levels of driving automation change social
					interaction in semi-automated road traffic, and how does the
					integration of sensor-driven media open up new possibilities to
					understand, design and evaluate such interactions? The unique focus of
					our approach is that interaction is viewed as a cooperative reality
					between all road users, cars, sensors, and their environments. Funded
