				This data set contains more than 36 hours of continuous raw acceleration
				data from a sensor node that was deployed at the rails of Deutsche Bahn.
				Almost 250 trains of different type (such as ICE/IC, regional passenger
				trains, cargo trains, or locomotives) were rolling by, causing vibration
				patterns which were recorded by our sensor. The aim of this data set is
				to evaluate combinations of easy-to-compute features that can be used on
				a sensor node for on-line classification of these 'train events'.

				The data set (<a href="https://uni-siegen.sciebo.de/s/9h2aQbMaOIZsjc3">
					TrainSpotting dataset</a
				>) contains raw sensor data as well as the annotations stored in the
				Python numerical library data format (numpy) file. Please make sure to
				read the README.fst in the archive for details on loading and accessing
				data.
